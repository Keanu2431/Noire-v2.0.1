# Noire E-Commerce
This is a work in progress project focused on implementing the use of databases,design,OOP, MVC architecture for manageable code on a big project and many other concepts of programming. Im currently in the process of converting what I currently have into a web application that is supported on the front-end and the back-end to apply every concept I learned to allow the application to function properly with data being stored and accessible from anywhere.
